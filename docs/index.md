## Introduction 

Welcome to the official user guide for **SwimmingIndividuals.jl v1.0**. This documentation provides a comprehensive resource for understanding the model's architecture, configuring and running simulations, and analyzing the output.

`SwimmingIndividuals.jl` is a next-generation modeling framework designed to simulate the life histories and population dynamics of marine organisms. It is built in the high-performance **Julia** programming language and leverages modern parallel computing to run efficiently on both multi-core **CPUs** and **NVIDIA GPUs**.

The modelâ€™s core philosophy is to simulate ecosystems from the *bottom-up*, where large-scale patterns in population size, distribution, and structure emerge from the mechanistic, process-based decisions of individual agents.
