## SwimmingIndividuals.jl

This repository holds the source code for *SwimmingIndividuals.jl* (SI), an agent-based ecosystem modeling software. SI takes basic biological traits (e.g., species' biomass, maximum individual size, swim speed) and simulates individual animal behavior decisions as a result of surrounding predator and prey fields.
