## SwimmingIndividuals.jl

This repository holds the source code for *SwimmingIndividuals.jl* (SI), an agent-based ecosystem modeling software. SI takes basic biological traits (e.g., species' biomass, maximum individual size, swim speed) and simulates individual animal behavior decisions as a result of surrounding predator and prey fields. Predator-prey interactions and environmental factors drive population dynamics through temperature-dependent bioenergetic rates that simulate individual animal growth and reproductive output from [ideally] realistic prey fields and environmental conditions. The model is in development, as new processes become made available and and model performance is improved. If SI could work for you, please reach out to me at my [email](msw200@miami.edu) to discuss collaborations until a sensible user guide and manuscript can be created.
